## Broadcasting RTT

Broadcasting round-trip time benchmark (based on [Hashrocket's bench](https://github.com/hashrocket/websocket-shootout)) measures how much time does it take for the server to re-transmit the message to all the connected clientsâ€“the less the time, the better the _real-time-ness_ of the server.

The results of this benchmark could be seen below.

## Memory usage

Memory usage of AnyCable is significantly lower than of Action Cable.

That's achieved by moving memory-intensive operations into (storing connection states and subscriptions maps, serializing data)into a standalone WebSocket server.
