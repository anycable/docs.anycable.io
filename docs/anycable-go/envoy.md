# Using AnyCable-Go with Envoy

[Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io) is a modern proxy server which supports HTTP2 and gRPC.

We can use Envoy for load balancing and zero-disconnect deployments.

See [the example configuration](https://github.com/anycable/anycable-go/tree/master/etc/envoy) in the `anycable-go` repo.
